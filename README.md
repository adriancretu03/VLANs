1) I configured Host Names, shutdown unused interfaces, configured secret password and vty passwords of cisco
2) I used VTP mode transparent and domain ccna and add VLANS 10,20,30,100 to the VLAN database
3) Then I configured ports between switches as trunks and access ports on links to PCs
4)I verified which ports are forwarding and blocking and optimized spanning tree with Core1 being root for odd VLANs and Core2 the root for even VLANS.
4) I configured Etherchannel on the core switches, also HSRP and optimized it
6) I also configured the DNS server for cisco.com, then the OSPF from the routers and the Internet Router.
7) Finally i verified that PCs could access cisco.com using their browsers
